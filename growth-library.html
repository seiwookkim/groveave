System 1 thinking (1+1=2) is automatic and error-prone while System 2 thinking (78 x 45 = ?) is deliberate and effortful. Kahneman walks us through his own research program’s findings regarding how intuition can (mostly) lead us astray and on how we can engage deliberate thinking to avoid these naturally-occurring judgmental errors.</p>

Based on a 20 year-long experimental study on how accurate experts were at forecasting the future, Tetlock and Gardner reveal that many were no better than a dart-throwing chimp.

As adventurer, hunter, conservationist, politician, reformer, lawyer, author, zoologist, and military officer, Roosevelt applied great discipline to the use of his time and achieved much even before taking the office of the President.</p>

                  <p>De Botton begins by examining the historical developments that have fueled the feeling of status, and with it, the anxiety that develops in individuals who strive to achieve it. He curates various rememdies offered by those who sought to escape the social anxiety trap, ranging from philosophers, psychologists, and novelists. A quick read that'll provoke some thoughts on having greater perspective about life and our daily anxieties.</p>

                  <p>"In adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics. Now, on the contrary, I enjoy life; I might almost say that with every year that passes I enjoy it more," writes Russell. In this classic and timeless volume, he goes on to expound on the causes of unhappiness and happiness, asserting that the "diminishing preoccupation" the self is largely what allows for happiness.</p>

                  <h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1TDW0xM">The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing by Michael Mauboussin</a></h4>
                  <p>Mauboussin discusses the importance of recognizing how skill and luck contribute to outcomes. The key idea–that luck is a major contributor to outcomes that people normally believe are within their span of control–allows people to differentiate between things that they should focus on and things they should ignore. He draws examples from gambling, games, sports, finance, and business.  </p>

                  <p>Frank points out that people tend to attribute their success to hard work rather than to luck but that even self-made individuals likely benefited from luck in one way or another. As Frank, points out, quoting E.B. White, “Luck is not something you can mention in the presence of self-made men.” But the lack of acknowledgement of luck leads to sanctimonious feelings and a general lack of gratitude towards the things that benefited you that were completely outside of your control, such as genetics, your parents, where you grew up, and a whole host of other factors.</p>

Jeff has multiple opportunities to “replay” his life but always ends up “dying” at age 43, his memory piling up with experiences, relationships, and tragedies of all his replays.
